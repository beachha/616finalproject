## Checkpoint 2:
This checkpoint is to ensure you are making adequate progress towards your final deliverable.  I will give you feedback by the end of day on November 27 on anything your turn in at this stage.  This checkpoint should include, at minimum, the following items:

### problem statement:  
This project addresses inconsistencies in tracking Business Analytics and ISA majors at FSB, with a drop from 84 majors in Spring 2023 to only 62 graduates in 2024. The goal is to develop a structured approach to classify students by academic standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior) to identify where discrepancies are. By standardizing student classification, we can clarify graduation counts, improve data reliability, and provide accessible insights into student progression from admission to graduation.

### Research questions:
●	Are current student grade levels accurate? If not, how are they classified and what would be a more accurate way to measure grade level? Credit hours, semesters enrolled, etc.
●	Why did the number of BA majors decrease from Spring 2023 to 2024? Did these students change majors, graduate early, transfer, etc.?
●	How can we ensure our analysis is reproducible for upcoming semesters?
●	What are the most effective ways to present enrollment and graduation data to make it accessible for the client?

### Business Value 
![Business Value](./ISA 616 Final Project BVP.png)

### List of deliverables: 
●	A reproducible code base to track and count student progression in declared majors within the ISA department

### Final Dataset Design:
Student Table Components
Rows : Distinct Students
Columns: 
●	Index: Unique Student ID 
●	Starting Semester: MIN Term Code - First Semester 
●	Semester Count: Count of terms codes (ending in 10 or 20– Spring–Fall)
●	Total Credits (counts)-  would be MAX(Count) for Each Student ID
●	Advanced Classes: Flags for specific classes  - The are classes that are required of each major and would indicate being further along in the major pipeline
○	For BA (ISA 401, ISA 414, ISA 491)
○	For IS (ISA 406, ISA 495)
●	Major Change: Flag if major is different than in starting term ( or 2 columns One for major in max one for major in MIN
●	Double Major: Dummy variable to indicate student with additional majors
●	GPA: cumulative from max term code
●	Graduated(Target): (Degrees Awarded Column) (0,1) label of classification


## Package Installation and Initialization

In this portion we use `pacman` to install the necessary packages and clear the global environment.

```{r setup,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = "100%")
#package initialization
rm(list = ls()) # clear global environment
graphics.off() # close all graphics
if(require(pacman)==FALSE) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(DataExplorer, # For explorer and cleaning data by visualizing missing values.
               httr, # For downloading the data from the UCI
               tidyverse, # For data manipulation
               corrplot, # for heatmaps
               DataExplorer, #for exploring data
               skimr, # for nice summary of data
               readxl, #to read Excel files
               networkD3 # to create a Sankey Plot
               ) # For creating dummy variables of categorical variables automatically.)

## Load data

### Loading BA Students

This is the list of students under consideration.  Here is the logic for this data pull:


```{r}
BA_Students=read_excel("BA Major Students.xlsx")
head(BA_Students)
paste("The number of rows in the data is ",nrow(BA_Students))
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(BA_Students$`Student ID`)))
write.csv(BA_Students,"data-clean/BA_Students_cleaned.csv")

```
### Loading IS Students

This is the list of students under consideration.  Here is the logic for this data pull:


```{r}
IS_Students=read_excel("IS Major Students.xlsx")
head(IS_Students)
paste("The number of rows in the data is ",nrow(IS_Students))
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(IS_Students$`Student ID`)))
write.csv(IS_Students,"data-clean/IS_Students_cleaned.csv")

```

### Loading BA Majors

Below I read in the data and fill in the missing values with the correct values.  The level of analysis is Student ID X Term Code.  Each student has a row for each term they have been enrolled.  Some students have one row, others have eight.

Finally, I make sure that each student has the Cohort Term that is equal to the earliest date on record.

```{r}
# Read data
BA_Majors=read_excel("./BA Major Students - Majors.xlsx")
# Fill in the blank cells created from the format of the data
BA_Majors=BA_Majors %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`:`Term Code`),.direction="down")
#Create a separate column for each major.  Unit of analysis here is student by Term Code
BA_Majors=BA_Majors %>% 
  group_by(`Student ID`,`Term Code`) %>% 
  mutate(Major_Number=paste("Major",row_number())) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=Major_Number, values_from=`BA Major`) 

# Set the Cohort Term to the smallest observed value for a given student. 
BA_Majors=BA_Majors %>% 
  group_by(`Student ID`) %>% 
  mutate(`Cohort Term`=min(`Cohort Term`)) 

head(BA_Majors)
paste("The number of rows is ",nrow(BA_Majors))
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique((BA_Majors$`Student ID`))))

write.csv(BA_Majors,"data-clean/BA_Majors_cleaned.csv")
```

IS_Majors=IS_Majors %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`:`Term Code`),.direction="down")
#Create a separate column for each major.  Unit of analysis here is student by Term Code
IS_Majors=IS_Majors %>%

write.csv(IS_Majors,"data-clean/IS_Majors_cleaned.csv")
```
### Loading BA Grades

Loaded student grades, filled in missing cells according to the data structure.  There are only 694 students.  This is possibly because the freshmen do not yet have grades. I checked this, and there are 140 freshmen who have no grades.  694+140=834.  We have 823 unique students in the file.  It is possible that 834+823=11 students in cohort 202410 have grades, possibly due to dual enrollment or summer classes prior to the Fall semester.

```{r}
# Read data
BA_Grades=read_excel("./BA Major Students - Grades -updated.xlsx")

# Fill in the blank cells created from the format of the data
BA_Grades = BA_Grades %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`),.direction="down")

head(BA_Grades)
tail(BA_Grades)
paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(BA_Grades$`Student ID`)))
num_fresh=BA_Majors %>%
  filter(`Cohort Term`=="202410")%>%
  nrow()
paste("The number of students starting in term 201410 is ", num_fresh)

write.csv(BA_Grades,"data-clean/BAGrades_cleaned.csv")
```
### Loading IS Grades

paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(IS_Grades$`Student ID`)))
num_fresh=IS_Majors %>% ##BA
  filter(`Cohort Term`=="202410")%>%
  nrow()
paste("The number of students starting in term 201410 is ", num_fresh)

write.csv(IS_Grades,"data-clean/ISGrades_cleaned.csv")
```
### Loading BA Attributes

Below I load in the Attributes.  There are 134 students with missing cumulative GPA.  

The level of analysis for the final data frame is Student ID X Term Code.

```{r}
# Read data
Attributes=read_excel("./BA Major Students - Attributes and GPA.xlsx")
# Fill in the blank cells created from the format of the data
Attributes = Attributes %>% 
  fill(c(`Student ID`:`First Generation Indicator`),.direction="down")

paste("The number of unique students is ",length(unique(Attributes$`Student ID`)))

head(Attributes)
test=Attributes %>% 
  filter(is.na('Term UG Crs GPA'))

paste("The number of students with no grades ",length(unique(test$`Student ID`)))

## Merging IS and BA files

### Merging BA_Majors and IS_Majors
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Read CSV files
BA <- read.csv('data-clean/BA_Majors_cleaned.csv')
IS <- read.csv('data-clean/IS_Majors_cleaned.csv')

# Drop the first column from BA and IS (regardless of its name)
BA <- BA %>% select(-1)  # Drop the first column
IS <- IS %>% select(-1)  # Drop the first column

# Drop 'Major 6' from BA if it exists
if ('Major 6' %in% names(BA)) {
  BA <- BA %>% select(-`Major 6`)
}

# Concatenate BA and IS
BS_IS <- bind_rows(BA, IS)

# Display the records after removing duplicates
unique_records <- BS_IS[!duplicated(BS_IS), ]
print(unique_records)

# Write the result to a CSV file
write.csv(unique_records, 'data-merged/BS_IS_Majors.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

### Merging BA_Attributes_cleaned and IS_Attributes_cleaned
```{r}
# Read CSV files
BA <- read.csv('data-clean/BA_Attributes_cleaned.csv')
IS <- read.csv('data-clean/IS_Attributes_cleaned.csv')

# Drop the first column from BA and IS (regardless of its name)
BA <- BA %>% select(-1)  # Drop the first column
IS <- IS %>% select(-1)  # Drop the first column

# Concatenate BA and IS
BS_IS <- bind_rows(BA, IS)

# Display the records after removing duplicates
unique_records <- BS_IS[!duplicated(BS_IS), ]
print(unique_records)

# Write the result to a CSV file
write.csv(unique_records, 'data-merged/BS_IS_Attributes.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

### Merging BA_Students_cleaned and IS_Students_cleaned
```{r}
# Read CSV files
BA <- read.csv('data-clean/BA_Students_cleaned.csv')
IS <- read.csv('data-clean/IS_Students_cleaned.csv')

# Drop the first column from BA and IS (regardless of its name)
BA <- BA %>% select(-1)  # Drop the first column
IS <- IS %>% select(-1)  # Drop the first column

# Concatenate BA and IS
BS_IS <- bind_rows(BA, IS)

# Display the records after removing duplicates
unique_records <- BS_IS[!duplicated(BS_IS), ]
print(unique_records)

# Write the result to a CSV file
write.csv(unique_records, 'data-merged/BS_IS_Students.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

### Merging BA_Gradess_cleaned and IS_Grades_cleaned
```{r}
# Read CSV files
BA <- read.csv('data-clean/BAGrades_cleaned.csv')
IS <- read.csv('data-clean/ISGrades_cleaned.csv')

# Drop the first column from BA and IS (regardless of its name)

# Write the result to a CSV file
write.csv(unique_records, 'data-merged/BS_IS_Grades.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

### Merging 'BA Major Students - Credit Hours.csv' and 'IS Major Students - Credit Hours.csv'
#### Checking the structure of the 'Student ID' in BA and IS files:
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Read CSV files
BA <- read.csv('data-clean/BA_Credits_Cleaned.csv')
IS <- read.csv('data-clean/IS_Credits_Cleaned.csv')

head(BA)
head(IS)

# Check the structure of the data to confirm column types
str(BA)
str(IS)

# Check column names
colnames(BA)
colnames(IS)
```
#### Changing the type of 'Student ID' in both files
As we can see, the 'Student ID' in BA is integer and in IS is character. So, we change the type of the 'Student ID' in IS to integer using the following code:

```{r}
IS$`Student.ID` <- as.integer(IS$`Student.ID`)

# If any 'Student ID' is NA (i.e., non-numeric), set it to NA
IS$`Student ID`[is.na(IS$`Student.ID`)] <- NA
```

#### Merging files

Now we can merge BA and IS using the following code:
```{r}
BS_IS <- bind_rows(BA, IS)

# Display the records after removing duplicates
unique_records <- BS_IS[!duplicated(BS_IS), ]
print(unique_records)

# Write the result to a CSV file
write.csv(unique_records, 'data-merged/BS_IS_Major_Students_Credit_Hours.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

### Merging 'BA Major Students - Degrees Awarded.csv' and 'IS Major Students - Degrees Awarded.csv'
```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Read CSV files
BA <- read.csv('data-clean/BA_degrees_awarded_cleaned.csv')
IS <- read.csv('data-clean/IS_degrees_awarded_cleaned.csv')

BS_IS <- bind_rows(BA, IS)

# Display the records after removing duplicates
unique_records <- BS_IS[!duplicated(BS_IS), ]
print(unique_records)

# Write the result to a CSV file
write.csv(unique_records, 'data-merged/BS_IS_Major_Students_Degrees_Awarded.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```
